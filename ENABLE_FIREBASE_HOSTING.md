# Enable Firebase Hosting - Step by Step

Follow these steps to enable Firebase Hosting for your project:

## Step 1: Open Firebase Console

Click this link to go directly to your project's Hosting page:
**[Open Firebase Hosting](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/trivium-97fe-4ada-8232-adc5a0be2596/hosting)**

## Step 2: Sign In

If prompted, sign in with your Google account that has access to this Firebase project.

## Step 3: Enable Hosting

You should see one of these:

### Option A: "Get Started" Button
- Click the **"Get Started"** button
- Follow the setup wizard (you can skip the CLI steps since we already have the config)
- Click **"Finish"** or **"Done"**

### Option B: Already Enabled
- If you see a deployment history or "Deploy" button, Hosting is already enabled!
- Skip to Step 4

## Step 4: Verify Hosting is Enabled

You should now see:
- A "Deploy" button
- Or a message saying "No deployments yet"
- Or existing deployment history

## Step 5: Return Here

Once you see the Hosting dashboard (not the "Get Started" screen), come back and let me know. I'll then run the deployment command to push your app live!
